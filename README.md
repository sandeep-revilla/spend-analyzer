# NLP Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. The goal is to analyze large-scale textual data using preprocessing, n-gram language models, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and topic modeling (LDA) to extract linguistic patterns and hidden themes.

## Dataset
- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
- Total reviews: 50,000
- Positive reviews: 25,000
- Negative reviews: 25,000
- Each review is stored as a plain text file

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Text Preprocessing
Loads raw reviews, cleans the text, and saves the cleaned corpus.
Output:
- `data/aclImdb_cleaned.pkl`

---

### 2. N-gram Language Modeling
Generates unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and computes sentence probabilities.

---

### 3. POS Tagging and Syntactic Analysis
Applies POS tagging and extracts syntactic patterns.

---

### 4. Topic Modeling (LDA)
Discovers hidden topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

---

## Running Tests
Basic sanity tests are written for each module.

Run all tests using:

---

## Results Summary
- N-gram analysis identified domain-specific phrases such as *good movie* and *bad movie*
- POS tagging showed high usage of nouns and adjectives, indicating descriptive language
- LDA with K = 10 produced the most interpretable topics
- Topic modeling revealed themes such as TV shows, family movies, war-related films, and storytelling

---

## Limitations
- Bag-of-words representation ignores word order
- Topics generated by LDA may overlap
- Topic interpretation is subjective

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective application of NLP techniques on a large text dataset. The analysis highlights meaningful linguistic patterns and thematic structures present in movie reviews.
